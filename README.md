# Feliz.Solid

This is an early prototype to compile F# to JSX in order to use a [Feliz-like](https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/Feliz/) HTML API with [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/).

To test run `npm install && npm start`. Note that JSX elements need to be **solved at compile time** so it's not possible to use list generators for HTML attributes or children.

> Note: Requires Fable 4 Snake Island (currently in alpha)
